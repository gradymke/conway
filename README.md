# Conway's Life

This is a little project I'm using to play around with AlpineJS and maybe some other things.

## Cellular Automata

Conway's Life is an example of a Cellular automata. A cellular automaton (CA) is a mathematical model that consists of a regular grid of cells, each in one of a finite number of states. The state of a cell evolves over discrete time steps according to a set of rules based on the states of neighboring cells. This simple model can produce complex patterns and behaviors.

### The Rules
There are myriad rules for different cellular automata. Conway's Life follows these rules:

1. **Survival**: Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors survives to the next generation.
2. **Death**: Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes a live cell (birth). All other cells die or stay dead.
3. **Isolation**: Any live cell with fewer than 2 live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
4. **Overcrowding**: Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors dies (overpopulation).

These rules are applied to every cell in the grid simultaneously, creating fascinating and dynamic patterns over time.

### Real World Applications

1. **Ecological Modeling**: Cellular automata can model the growth and interaction of biological species, helping scientists understand ecosystem dynamics.
2. **Urban Planning**: CAs are used to simulate the growth of cities and predict urban development patterns.
3. **Material Science**: They can model the behavior of materials at a microscopic level, helping in the design and analysis of new materials.
4. **Traffic Flow**: Cellular automata are used to model traffic flow and optimize traffic systems.
5. **Cryptography**: Some cellular automata exhibit complex behavior that can be used in cryptographic systems.

## The Approach

For this project I'm trying out a micro framework called [AlpineJS](https://alpinejs.dev/). AlpineJS has a philosophy that most of your work should be done in HTML and CSS, and you should just decorate that world with Javascript to introduce appropriate dynamism.

I'm also interested in working through some smaller CSS libraries. The "styling approach-du jour" is likely Tailwind, but it seems pretty heavy to learn. I'd like to work with something that can be small, opinionated, but simple, then can be added to through self-generated (or AI generated) CSS. Currently I'm using [SimpleCSS](https://simplecss.org/), which I don't love, but it's somewhere to start in order to compare other approaches to.

Last, I'm experimenting with AI and coding. I'm using a combination of [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/) with the [Devstral](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Devstral-Small-2507) model, driven from the [Zed Editor](https://zed.dev/). So far it has generated some reasonable improvements to the original code, including the Generation Status Bar as well as some minor CSS tweaks. It also attempted to generate this README file, but sort of failed at that. Some of the content was generated by this model, but the automated editing of the file had some issues.

## Next Steps
I have some things I'd like to explore in this code that will help to further my understanding of more modern HTML/CSS/JS front-ends.

* Better drawing - the current approach relies on cell clicks to toggle the cell's state. I'd like to make it respond to mouse-down and drag metaphors for simpler drawing.
* Better CSS - the toolboxes are uninspiring. I'd like to mess with the CSS to make those more interesting.
* Saving State - I want to be able to persist the current grid to the browser's storage (local storage) and be able to re-hydrate it from there as well.
* Backend - I may mess around with [Pocketbase](https://pocketbase.io/) as a generic backend and try to persist things there.

This will all help with some future projects I have in mind that are more complex than this simple Conway's Life program.
